All of our team members have to take the airplane to get home over breaks,
so we all recognize the cumbersome task of posting on Snapchat and hoping that someone also has a flight around the same time as you so you can Uber together to LAX/back 
(fares are incredibly high).
Thus, we set out to make a platform that unified the ridesharing for not only USC students 
but also students from any school that may want to coordinate cab rides to the airport with other students from their school.


We created Bon-Bon Voyage collaboratively using GitHub, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
We also connected it to a Firebase database, which we also all collaborated on.
The database was configured to store matches, rides, and users (so far).
